This site is long overdue. It will ultimately be a collection of my various interests and plus a means to highlight some of the cool projects I've been able to work on. Some fun projects I've been involved with include human/machine handoff and automation, computer vision, various integrations, etc.   

In the meantime, some information about myself. My name is Riley and I'm based in Austin, TX. I did my undergrad in Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, but have largely been on the process control / automation / software side of things since. 

Roughly half of my career has been focused on the Lifesciences side of things (pharmaceuticals and medical devices) and the other half in general manufacturing.
