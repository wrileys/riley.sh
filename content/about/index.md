Hi, I’m Riley Shuping.

![Me](/images/profile.jpg)

I'm a Chemical Engineer that does automation / manufacturing software located in Austin, Texas. 
I enjoy a bit of photography, music, keeping up to date on the latest technology, and trying to keep a reasonable workout routine despite the current state of everything. 

I'm extremely curious about the world and love to learn about how things work. My favorite author is Vaclav Smil simply because of his incredible blend of thoroughness and depth. 

My guiding principle is simple: I aim to help and enable others.
